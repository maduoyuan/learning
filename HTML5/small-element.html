        <h1>small</h1>
        <p>The <mark>small</mark> element <em>represents</em> <small>(Elements
           in the DOM <mark>represent</mark> things; that is, they have
           <em>intrinsic meaning</em>, also known as <em>semantics</em>)</small>
           side comments such as small print.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The <mark>small</mark> element should not be used for extended spans of
       text, such as multiple paragraphs, lists, or sections of text. It is only
       intended for short runs of text. The text of a page listing terms of use,
       for instance, would not be a suitable candidate for the
       <mark>small</mark> element: in such a case, the text is not a side
       comment, it is the main content of the page.</p>
    
    <p>The <mark>small</mark> element must not be used for subheadings; for that
       purpose, use the <mark>hgroup</mark> element.</p>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>Small print typically features disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions,
       or copyrights. Small print is also sometimes used for attribution, or for
       satisfying licensing requirements.</p>

    <p>The <mark>small</mark> element does not "de-emphasize" or lower the
       importance of text emphasized by the <mark>em</mark> element or marked as
       important with the <mark>strong</mark> element. To mark text as not
       emphasized or important, simple do not mark it up with the
       <mark>em</mark> or <mark>strong</mark> elements respectively.</p>
