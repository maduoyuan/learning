        <p>Bootstrap's global default <em>font-size</em> is
           <strong>14px</strong>, with a <em>line-height</em> of
           <strong>1.428</strong> (about <strong>20px</strong>).</p>
        <p>This is applied to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and all paragraphs
           (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>).</p>
        <p>In addition, all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements hava a <em>bottom
           margin</em> that equals <em>half</em> their computed line-height
           (<strong>10px</strong> by default).</p>

                <p>The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple
                   with. It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply
                   held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we
                   desperately want to be true. But our preferences do not
                   determine what's true. We have a method, and that method
                   helps us to reach not absolute truth, only asymptotic
                   approaches to the truth â€” never there, just closer and
                   closer, always finding vast new oceans of undiscovered
                   possibilities. Cleverly designed experiments are the key.</p>

        <p>He began his list of "lessons" with the following:</p>
        <blockquote>One should never assume that his side of the issue will be
                    recognized, let alone that it will be conceded to have
                    merits.</blockquote>
        <p>He continued with a number of similar points, ending with:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">Finally, one should be prepared for the threat of breakdown
                    in negotiations at any given moment and not be cowed by the
                    possibility.</blockquote>
